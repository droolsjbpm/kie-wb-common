>>>>>>> fixing the standalone showcase README to refer back to the newly updated one so everything is in one place

  - **Stunner Standalone Showcase** focuses on presenting basic UberFire (Appformer)/Errai components, such as Process Designer, skipping over the more involved & resource-intensive integration of KIE Workbench/Library and Guvnor project components.

  - **Stunner Project Showcase** is built atop the KIE Workbench, Commons, Guvnor and Library components. This more complex showcase demonstrates integration with different KIE Workbench assets and editors. However, for day-to-day development, it is strongly suggested that the Standalone Showcase be utilized over this more complex showcase when working with Stunner components.
